Module 0: Course introduction
=============================

Practice Lab – Validate lab environment
---------------------------------------

Scenario
--------

Bellows College is an educational organization with multiple buildings on campus. Campus visits are currently recorded in paper journals. The information is not captured consistently, and there are no means to collect and analyze data about the visits across the entire campus. 

Campus administration would like to modernize their visitor registration system where access to the buildings is controlled by security personnel and all visits are required to be pre-registered and recorded by their hosts.

Throughout this course, you will build applications and perform automation to enable the Bellows College administration and security personnel to manage and control access to the buildings on campus.

**Important Note:** This lab will provide you with an actual Dynamics 365 tenant
and licenses for the Power Platform applications you will be using in this
course. Please be aware that the Power Platform is evolving all the time. The
instructions in this document may be different from what you experience in your
actual tenant. It is also possible to experience a delay of several minutes
before the virtual machine has network connectivity to begin the labs.

Exercise 1 – Set up your Practice environment
---------------------------------------------

In this exercise, you will be create your **Practice** environment that you will
do the majority of your lab work in.

### Task 1 – Create environment

1.  Access <https://admin.Powerplatform.microsoft.com> and log in with your user
    credentials.

**Important:** Please be aware that this tenant and the Dynamics 365
organization will be shared with the other students in your classroom, like
employees would share a tenant when using the Dynamics 365 instance belonging to
their organization. Do not use any PII (personally identifiable information)
when creating records. It is also good practice to use your username prefix
(ex., **mollyc**) in front of all records, data, apps, flows, etc. you create.

1.  Select **Environments** and click **+New.**

    -   For **Name**, enter **[my prefix] Practice.** (Example: mollyc
        Practice.)

    -   For **Type**, select **Trial.**

    -   Change the toggle on **Create a database for this environment?** to
        **Yes.**

    -   Leave all other selections as default and click **Save.**

    -   On the next tab, leave all selections to default and click **Save**
        again.

2.  Your **Practice** environment should now show in the list of Environments.
    You may also see other students' environments in this list with their
    individual prefixes; only work within your Practice environment.

3.  Your environment may take a few minutes to provision. Refresh the page if
    needed. When your environment is prepared, select your **Practice**
    environment by clicking on the ellipses next to its name to expand the drop
    down menu and select **Settings.**

4.  Explore the different areas in **Settings** that you are interested in but
    do not make any changes yet.
